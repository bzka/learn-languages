i got a weird way of learning and remembering things
since i want to learn how to speak greek i thought id make a program to help with it

you are welcome to change the language to one of your choice

how it works;
you say for example hello in the left textbox (english)
once you press enter your cursor will be redirected to the right side(greek)

now by all means this is not good code nor is it my best work.. it just works 

and as simple as that, maybe itll be useful to anyone else
